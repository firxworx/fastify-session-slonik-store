/**
 * Return a slonik result parser interceptor that uses Zod to parse query results.
 *
 * This is a typical use-case for slonik: it was originally the default behaviour of slonik when zod parsing was
 * introduced. This was rolled back as a default behaviour as not all users required zod by default.
 *
 * However zod support is a premiere feature of slonik and is extremely common in a typical slonik-powered
 * application.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/gajus/slonik#result-parser-interceptor
 * @see https://github.com/gajus/slonik/issues/499#issuecomment-1714136993 to explain the `as` casts to fix types
